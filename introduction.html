    <h2>Information on this map</h2>
    <div class="description">This map shows all emissions of CO and CO<sub>2</sub> in Europe <b>in selected industrial categories that contain processes with Carbon4PUR compatible emissions</b> according to
        the <a href="https://prtr.eea.europa.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E-PRTR</a>. For more detail on the E-PRTR
        data and how it was obtained, read the <a href="#data-section" onclick="map.sidebar.open('legal-content')">data section</a>.<br>
        The tabs on the left allow to filter those emissions to obtain possible replication sites for a
        Carbon4PUR plant. The first tab contains filters based on the type of emissions, the second tab
        filters based on possible plants.
        <h2>Legend</h2>
        <h3>CO/CO<sub>2</sub> emitters</h3>
        CO emissions are displayed with an <span style="border: 1px solid rgb(234,110,57); border-radius: 4px;">orange</span> border and all
        CO<sub>2</sub> emissions with a	<span style="border: 1px solid rgb(241, 177, 48); border-radius: 4px;">yellow</span> border. The fill
        color depends on the type of plant (see colors in the second tab on the left or click on any circle
        on the map). The size indicates the amount of CO or CO<sub>2</sub> available.
        <h3>CO/CO<sub>2</sub> users (chemical plants)</h3>
        Chemical plants are <span style="background: rgba(0,168,189,0.6); border-radius: 4px;">blue</span>
        and
        polyol plants <span style="background: rgba(12,168,118,0.6); border-radius: 4px;">green</span>.
        Those are potential sites for the Carbon4PUR technology. CO and CO<sub>2</sub> have to be available
        nearby, and the size of the circle corresponds to the radius (defined by the user) in which transporting
        those gases might be economical.
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        You can add filters to narrow down the emissions:<ul class="is-bullet">
            <li>to those compatible with the Carbon4PUR process or by emission type and source </li>
            <li>and to those near an existing chemical parc, polyol plant or steel mill . This tab also allows for analysis of available CO/CO<sub>2</sub>, ethylene oxide and propylene oxide as well as some analytics.</li>
            <li>The tab contains information about data, licences and privacy and</li>
            <li>in the settings tab contains advanced options like map layout and a possibility to load and save your own consumers.</li>
        </ul>
